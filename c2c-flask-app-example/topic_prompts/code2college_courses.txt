general info about code2college:
About Code2College
Code2College is a growing non-profit organization based in Austin, TX with a mission to 
dramatically increase the number of minority and low-income high school students who enter 
and excel in STEM undergraduate majors and careers. The students we serve often lack access 
to some of the most in-demand careers and technical industries. Further, the absence of 
opportunity to explore these areas through exposure to industry professionals, 
technical skills development, and at-bats to practically apply these skills has led in 
part to the dearth of diverse technical talent that we see today. We believe that through our 
approach to education, exposure, and experience, we can enhance student preparation for rigorous, 
technical careers and mitigate some of the key factors around STEM attrition. Code2College has 
served over 2,000 students since 2016 and we plan to have served over 8,000 students by 2024.

Our Mission
The mission of Code2College is to dramatically increase the number of minority and low-income high school students who enter and excel in STEM undergraduate majors and careers.
Our Vision
Find tech talent â€“ Our nation is facing a crisis. Despite its tendency towards innovation, thousands of impactful tech companies, and several world-class research institutions, there remains a shortage of skilled talent to fill a wide variety of technical roles. Companies continue to source technical talent from abroad, and as the explosive (and consistent) growth of the industry would indicate, the pace is far from slowing down. By providing youth employment opportunities to those in Code2College, students are given a chance to begin professional development from an early age.
Create diversity in STEM â€“ Whatâ€™s worse, we have a population of students in the US who remain underserved. Facing a talent surplus and opportunity deficit, many girls, students of color, and low-income students lack two of the most critical factors for entering pathways into STEM careers: industry exposure and practical experience. Students who havenâ€™t met a data scientist or heard of the investment banking industry are unlikely to pursue these or other technical fields. Those who do will find themselves behind the curve once matched against their affluent or well-resourced counterparts.
Unique Opportunity â€“ An opportunity to develop a pipeline of diverse, technical talent for our nation. Code2College is a multi-year, career prep and college access program that leverages volunteer technical talent to teach coding and web development skills to traditionally underrepresented students in order to support them through college and into STEM careers, promoting digital inclusion. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code2College is the FIRST and ONLY program that places high school students into paid, technical internships.

How this works
Code2College creates STEM college and career access through a 9-month internship preparation & placement program model. There are 3 aspects to this model: Education, Exposure and Experience.
